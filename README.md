Project Title: Food Delivery App
Overview:â€¨I developed a food delivery application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to browse local restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time.
Key Features:
* User Authentication: Implemented secure user registration and login with JWT for session management.
* Food Listings: Users can view a restaurant with menus, images, and prices.
* Order Management: Customers can add items to their cart, place orders, and receive order confirmations.
Admin Dashboard: Developed a separate interface for restaurant owners to manage their menu items, orders, and view analytics.

Technologies Used:
* Frontend: React.js for building a dynamic user interface, or state management.
* Backend: Node.js and Express.js for creating RESTful APIs.
* Database: MongoDB for storing user, restaurant, and order data.

Outcome:
This project improved my full-stack development skills, particularly in handling asynchronous data and managing state in complex applications.
